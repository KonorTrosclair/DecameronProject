                    <h1>Generosity: </h1>
                    <p>
                        The story begins in Pavia, where Messer Torello, a noble gentleman, meets a sultan, Saladin, disguised as a merchant.
                        When Messer meets Saladin, he assures him that he will not reach the gates of Pavia in time.
                        To remedy the situation, Messer offers to send over a servant who will guide Saladin and his companions to Pavia as well as direct them to their lodgings.
                        Without the men suspecting, the servant brought them to his lord's residence, where, upon seeing them, Messer welcomed them with a smile.
                        Through his foresight, Messer did not reveal where his servant was leading them, so they had no chance to refuse his hospitality.
                        After having stayed one night, Messer takes Saladin and his companions to a nearby river, where he shows off how well-trained his falcons are.
                        Throughout their stay, Messer provides the men with a grand banquet, lavish cloths, excellent horses, and escorts them out of Pavia at the end of their stay.

                        After parting ways with Saladin, Messer Torello was decides to join the crusades. 
                        He asked his wife if he was not to return from the war, that she might wait a year, a month, and a day before remarrying.
                        In response to his words, Messer's wife gave him a ring so that if she were to die while he was away, he would be able to remember her by the ring.
                        After the exchange with his wife, Messer Torello took the ring, mounted his horse, and set out on his journey, where he would eventually join the Christian army.

                    <h1>Captured: </h1>
                    <p>
                        While off at war, the Christian army was struck by sickness and mortality, and the surviving members of the army were soon captured and imprisoned in various cities by Saladin.
                        While being captured and sent to Alexandria, Messer kept his identity a secret for fear of his safety.
                        Messer Torello made himself known only as a trainer of hawks, taking up a job as a hawk trainer while captured.
                        Due to Saladin's recent experience with hawk training, he takes Messer out of prison and makes him his personal falconer, though neither of them recognizes the other.
                        Devising a plan with his hawks, Messer made a particular motion with his mouth, which prompted Saladin to question the origin of his new falcon trainer.
                        Upon revealing that Messer was a "poor man from Pavia," Saladin proceeded to show Messer the lavish clothes gifted to him by Messer's wife.
                        Reluctant to reveal his name and true status, Messer denies ever seeing the clothes. 
                        Still convinced of Messer's true identity, Saladin reveals himself to be one of the three merchants that Messer helped.
                        After revealing this, the two rejoiced, and Messer was now treated as a royal guest.

                        Having not received any response from Pavia Messer Torello grew depressed, fearing that his wife had remarried and everyone else had dismissed him as dead.
                        As a result, Messer lost sleep and appetite, determined to die.
                        After becoming aware of Messer's state and reason for his depression, Saladin asks a practitioner of black magic for help.
                        The practitioner then casts a spell putting Messer to sleep while also magically transporting the bed he was sleeping on back to Pavia in one night.

                    <p>
                        Just as he had requested, Messer Torello was transported back to the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia.
                        While at the church, Messer is made aware that his wife, against her will, is to be handed off to another man.
                        Upon hearing this news, Messer decides to secretly observe his wife at the wedding feast.
                        Messer notices his wife's sadness and her occasional glances toward him, but she does not recognize him because his appearance has changed, and she believes him dead.
                        To test her memory of the ring, Messer asks for a cup of wine as a courtesy to guests.
                        After receiving the cup of wine, Messer drops his wife's ring into the cup and hands it back to his wife.
                        Noticing the ring, Messer's wife is overcome with joy, throwing herself into his arms.
                        Honorably, the bridegroom accepts the situation, admitting that Messer has the rightful claim to his wife.
                        Messer's wife then wears her ring again, and the wedding party is moved to Messer's house.

            <h1>Summary: </h1>
            <p>
                        The story of Messer Torello and the Sultan Saladin displays the theme of how generosity can be rewarded in unexpected ways.
                        In the beginning, we meet Messer Torello as a courteous and cultured nobleman who shows hospitality to a stranger.
                        Later in the story, however, when Messer is off at war during the crusades, he is captured by Saladin's army.
                        Eventually, Saladin realizes that Messer Torello is imprisoned in the city where he is staying and decides to give Messer the same hospitality that was shown to him.
                        It is when Messer is at his lowest, fearing that his wife may be getting remarried, that Saladin repays Messer's generosity by getting him magically transported back to Pavia. 
                        Once back at Pavia, Messer finally reunites with his wife, resulting in a happy conclusion of the story.
                        Had Messer never shown generosity to Saladin, who at the time was a stranger disguised as a merchant, Messer would have never been shown the same hospitality while captured in the city of Alexandria.
                        Furthermore, Messer would have never been transported back to Pavia in time to reclaim his wife.
                        This story is a great example of how helping others out in their time of need can benefit you in an unexpected way.
