                    <p>
                        The story begins in pavia where Messer Torello, a noble gentleman, comes into contact with a sultan named Saladin who is disguised as a merchant.
                        When Messer meets Saladin he assures him that he will not make it to the gates of Pavia in a timely fashion.
                        To remedy the situation Messer offers to send over a servant that will guid Saladin and his companions to pavia as well as direct them to their lodgings.
                        Without the men suspecting, the servant brought them to his lords residence where upon seeing them Messer welcomed them with a smile.
                        Through his foresight, Messer did not reveal where his servant was leading them, so they had no chance to refuse his hospitality.
                        After having stayed one night messer takes Saladin and his companions to a nearby river where he showed off how well trained his falcons were.
                        Throughout their stay Messer provides the men with a grand banquet, lavish cloths, excellent horses, as well as escorting them out of Pavia at the end of their stay.

                    <p> 
                       After parting ways with Saladin, Messer Torello was resolved to join the crusades. 
                       He asked his wife, if he was to not return from the war, that she might wait a year, a month, and a day before remarying.
                       In response to his words Messer's wife gave him a ring so that if she was to die while he was away that he may be able to remember her by the ring.
                       After the exchange with his wife Messer Torello took the ring, mounted his horse, and set out on his journey where he would eventually join the christian army.

                    <h1>Captured: </h1>
                    <p>
                        While off at war the christian army was strucken by sickness and mortality where the surving members of the army were soon captured and imprisoned in variouse cities by Saladin.
                        While being captured and sent to Alexandria Messer kept his identy a secret in fear of his safty.
                        Messer Torello made himself known only as a trainer of hawks taking up a job as a hawk trainer while captured.
                        Due to Saladin's recent experience with hawk training he takes Messer out of prison and makes him his personal falconer, though neither of them recognizes the other.
                        Devising a plan with his hawks Messer made a particular motion with his mouth wich prompted Saladin to quetion the origin of his new falcon trainer.
                        Upon revealing that Messer was a "poor man from Pavia," Saladin proceeded to show Messer the lavish clothes gifted to him by Messer's wife.
                        Reluctant to reveal his name and true status, Messer denies ever seeing the cloths. 
                        Still convinced of Messer's true identy Saladin reveals himself to be one of the three merchants that Messer helped.
                        After revealing this the two rejoiced in which Messer was now treated as a royal guest.

                    <p>
                        Having not recieved any response from Pavia Messer Torello grew depressed fearing that his wife has remarried and everyone else has dismissed him as dead.
                        As a result Messer lost sleep and appitite determined to die.
                        After becoming aware of Messer's state and reason for his depression, Saladin asks a practitioner of black magic for help.
                        The practitioner then casts a spell putting Messer to sleep while also magically transporting the bed he was sleeping on back to Pavia in one night.

                    <p>
                        Just as he had requested, Messer Torello was transported back to the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia.
                        While at the church Messer is made aware that his wife, against her will, is to be handed off to another man.
                        Upon hearing this news Messer decides to secretly observe his wife at the wedding feast.
                        Messer notices his wife's sadness and her occasional glances toward him, but she does not recognize him because his appearance has changed and she believes him dead.
                        To test her memory of the ring Messer asks for a cup of wine as a courtasy to guests.
                        After recieving the cup of wine Messer drops his wifes ring into the cup and hands it back to his wife.
                        Noticing the ring, Messer's wife is overcome with joy throwing herself into his arms.
                        Honerably, the bridegroom accepts the situation admiting that Messer has the rightful claim to his wife.
                        Messer's wife then wears her ring again and the wedding party is moved to Messer's house.
